# KiloA
### A custom Kilo editor implementation by A-AC
### For Linux 

## Extra functions
- Added Python recognition
- (So far...)

## To Run
KiloA uses CMake to handle compiling so '$ make'
should compile to generate an executable, which can be referenced or moved to your bin folder to be accessed from anywhere in the OS

I don't expect to work a lot on this project and it's more a base for building more features :)
